## Home Motion Detection System

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Home Motion Detection System project, developed as a task for the Pearson Level 3 Diploma in Information Technology. The project utilizes NodeMcu ESP8266, a buzzer, LED, PIR motion sensor, email, and Blynk platform to create a comprehensive home security solution.

## Description:

The Home Motion Detection System is designed to detect motion in a home environment using a PIR motion sensor. Upon detecting motion, the system activates a buzzer and LED to alert inhabitants of the potential intrusion. Additionally, an email notification is sent to the owner to inform them of the detected motion, providing real-time updates on home security status.

## Features:

- **PIR Motion Detection:** Utilizing a PIR motion sensor, the system accurately detects motion within the home environment.
- **Alert Mechanisms:** Upon motion detection, a buzzer and LED are activated to provide audible and visual alerts.
- **Email Notification:** The system sends an email notification to the owner, providing real-time updates on detected motion.
- **Integration with Blynk:** The project integrates with the Blynk platform to send notifications to the owner's Blynk app, allowing them to monitor home security status remotely.
- **Dashboard and Statistics:** Through the Blynk app, users can access a dashboard displaying statistics and insights into motion detection events.
